Hi! The goal in doing this project was to practice API use in C# using three APIs, each that gives quotes with different API returns. The three APIs used are kanye.rest, ron-swanson-quotes, and Animechan. The code will print to the console a quote from Kanye, then Ron Swanson (anime quotes after Ron, though the method call for anime quotes is usually commented out) using the appropriate API. Sometimes the quotes line up in a pretty funny way!
