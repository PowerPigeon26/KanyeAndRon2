Hi! The goal in doing this project was to practice API use in C# using three APIs. The three APIs used are kanye.rest, ron-swanson-quotes, and Animechan. The code will print to the console a quote from Kanye, then Ron Swanson (anime quotes after Ron, though the method call for anime quotes is usually commented out) after using the appropriate API and parsing its response. Sometimes the quotes line up in a pretty funny way!
